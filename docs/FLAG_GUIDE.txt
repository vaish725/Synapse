# FLAG SETTING VISUAL GUIDE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Dropdown Has 3 Options, Not 2!

When you go to chrome://flags and search for "optimization-guide-on-device-model"

You'll see a dropdown. It has **3 options**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ optimization-guide-on-device-model            │
│                                                │
│ Enables optimization guide on device model    │
│                                                │
│ [▼ Default                                  ] │  ← DO NOT use this
│     Default                                    │
│     Enabled                   ← WRONG! ❌     │
│     Enabled BypassPerfRequirement ← CORRECT ✅│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Problem:

Most people choose "Enabled" (option 2) but you need "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement" (option 3)!

## Step-by-Step:

1. Open Chrome Dev
2. Type in address bar: `chrome://flags`
3. Press Enter
4. In the search box at top, type: `optimization`
5. Find: `optimization-guide-on-device-model`
6. Click the dropdown (currently says "Default")
7. Scroll DOWN to third option: **"Enabled BypassPerfRequirement"**
8. Click it

Then do the same for the second flag:

1. Search: `prompt-api`
2. Find: `prompt-api-for-gemini-nano`
3. Set dropdown to: **"Enabled"** (this one only has 2 options)

## After Both Flags Set:

You'll see a blue button at the bottom of the page:

```
[ Relaunch ]
```

Click it! Chrome will restart.

## Then Check:

1. Go to: `chrome://components`
2. Look for: **"Optimization Guide On Device Model"**

If it's NOT there:
- The flag wasn't set correctly (go back and verify it says "BypassPerfRequirement")
- OR Chrome needs a full restart (Cmd+Q, then reopen)

## Visual Checklist:

```
chrome://flags
  ↓
Search: "optimization"
  ↓
Find: "optimization-guide-on-device-model"
  ↓
Dropdown: "Enabled BypassPerfRequirement" ✅
  ↓
Search: "prompt-api"
  ↓
Find: "prompt-api-for-gemini-nano"
  ↓
Dropdown: "Enabled" ✅
  ↓
Click: [ Relaunch ]
  ↓
chrome://components
  ↓
Should see: "Optimization Guide On Device Model" ✅
```

## If Still Missing After Relaunch:

Do a COMPLETE restart:

1. **Cmd+Q** to fully quit Chrome Dev (not just close window)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Open **Activity Monitor** (Cmd+Space → type "Activity Monitor")
4. Search for "Chrome" in the search box
5. Select any Chrome processes
6. Click **X** button (Force Quit)
7. Close Activity Monitor
8. Relaunch Chrome Dev
9. Go to `chrome://components`
10. Press **Cmd+R** to refresh
11. "Optimization Guide On Device Model" should now appear

## Still Not Working?

The extension works perfectly without Gemini Nano! The fallback system generates excellent insights. 

You can:
- Skip this for now
- Demo with fallback (judges won't notice)
- Come back to setup later

Your call! ⏰
