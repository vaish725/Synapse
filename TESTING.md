## üìä Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

These are expected limitations of the MVP:
1. **Pomodoro state doesn't persist** across browser restarts (intentional for MVP)
2. **AI insights are mock data** until Gemini Nano integration is complete
3. **No time-of-day tracking** (only total daily time per site)
4. **Icons are placeholder** (purple circles)
5. **No dark mode** (coming in Phase 2)
